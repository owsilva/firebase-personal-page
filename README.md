### Hi, I'm Walace Silva 👋

I've been working as indie maker and full statck web programmer. Currently I'm working in a Startup as developer where I'm co-founder. I also Freelance the free times.

- ⚕️ I've had academic experience in health tech. I'd _love_ to work on that subject, too.
- 🌱 I'm currently studying Phython and sharpening my DevOps skills.
- ⚗️ I try some Elixir programming now and then and it's very likely my next language.
